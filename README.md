The system is really straight forward, Run the #list.py code and at any point run the #sender.py file to send your message that tells #list.py what to do.

I made this in a way that expects you to change the code. Change the list so it does your goals, Change the message type #list is listening for, and most importantly, make sure #sender.py is sending the message to the right IP.
So as is now, you gotta dive in the (simple) code to change some things around. I will make these 2 codes more "user friendly" soon.

A GUI is also in the making.

Happy coding!
